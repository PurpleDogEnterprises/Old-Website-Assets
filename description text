Purple Dog Animal Sanctuary

As it sets the stage for building, Sean Guthrie's 501(c)(3) non-profit public charity works on 3 major problems:

 Providing shelter for animals (especially abandoned older dogs) Reducing waste by using landfill tires as part of thermal mass rammed-earth wall systems Using ecologically-sound methods including renewable energy along with recycled and repurposed materials to reduce cost and promote sustainability (while wholeheartedly encouraging others to do so as well)

Purple Dog Leadership

This is the branch of Purple Dog Enterprises focusing on education, communication, publishing, and leadership.  Its ongoing mission is to promote lifelong learning and questioning, to encourage others to help themselves and others, and to collectively motivate us.  I am also running for Florida's U.S. Senate Seat in 2016 as an Independent with no party affiliation.  While I am completely different than any Republican or Democrat nominee and may be just another guy in the crowd and not a millionaire political insider, I can bring leadership instead of politics while encouraging others to do so as well. 

"I am the one who barks!"

Many political cowards try to make politics boring and dull so that regular working people donâ€™t participate. I however, wish to show humor and use it as a weapon against the establishment in order to further demonstrate just how out of touch and utterly absurd American politics has become, thereby demonstrating the need for real change.
